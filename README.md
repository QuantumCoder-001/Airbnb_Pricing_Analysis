🏠 Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Dashboard

📊 Predictive analytics + interactive visualization for smarter Airbnb pricing decisions

🚀 Project Overview

This project combines machine learning and interactive data visualization to build a dynamic pricing solution for Airbnb listings.

A Random Forest Regression model was trained to predict optimal prices based on features like:

Location (neighbourhood)

Room type

Availability

Reviews & ratings

Minimum nights, bedrooms, etc.

A Tableau Dashboard was built for interactive exploration, enabling hosts to test pricing scenarios and apply custom adjustments.

✨ The goal: Help hosts make data-driven decisions and optimize revenue while staying competitive.
